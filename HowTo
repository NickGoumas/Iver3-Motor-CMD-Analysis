1) On the 'Load Log File' tab use the 'Browse' button to load the Iver3 log file. (.log)

2) The log file is loaded as a pandas dataframe. Use the 'Mission Leg Filter' to remove 
rows from the dataframe which are either too short or too close to the surface to be 
valuable for analysis.

3) On the 'Power AND Speed Table' tab the program will try to determine the 'Motor 
Prefix.' Double check 'Motor Prefix' and the 'Battery Specs.' Click the 'Generate' 
button to produce the two tables. Copy and paste these tables over the file's content 
in UVC to use.

4) The 'Quick Report' tab gives some analysis of the loaded log file. The 'Motor CMD 
Regression Analysis' section gives the coefficient of determination (R Squared) value
and the linear relationship function between the motor command value and speed in knots.
The intercept value is the command used to stop the motor. The 'Power Regression 
Analysis' section gives the cubic function needed to determine burn power at speed. 
The 'Create Report' button creates a simple html file saved to the current directory.
It plots the averaged rows and the power fuction and displays the power fucntion as well.

The 'Append Database' section is an experimental tool that will probably be removed 
later. I don't think it will provide much utility to a user.
